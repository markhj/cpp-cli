### ðŸ”§ Build with CMake

You're now ready to build the library.

@note If the ``build`` directory doesn't already exist, you might
have to create it. But it should normally get created when CMake is configured.

Now, please run:

````
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
````
