@page testing Testing of the library

You can test the library with the built-in test suite.
The test suite is written in [C++ BBUnit](https://github.com/markhj/cpp-bbunit).

To build the test suite, you need to provide the environment variable ``BUILD_TESTS`` (set to ``1``),
when building the project.
